<h3 align="center">Trainee Python developer</h3>
    <p>My goal is to develop my skills in the field of programming and become a professional in Python development. I study new aspects of Python and development every day, and I am ready to put all my efforts into this process. One of the most effective ways of learning for me is being in an environment where I can learn practically. That's why I'm looking for a company where I can gain practical experience and a deeper understanding of Python programming. I aspire not only to acquire knowledge and skills but also to contribute to your projects. I believe that my assistance can be valuable to your team.
    </p>
